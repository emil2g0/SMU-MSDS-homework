1. FiveThirtyEight Data (30 points):
Install the fivethirtyeight package:
install.packages(“fivethirtyeight”)
In the listing of Data sets in package ‘fivethirtyeight,’ assign the eighteenth data set to an object ‘df.’
HW4 <- college_grad_students
Use a more detailed list of the data sets to write out the URL in a comment to the related news story.

Using R command(s), give the dimensions and column names of this data frame.

dim(HW4) [1] 173 22
colnames(HW4) [1] “major_code” “major”
[3] “major_category” “grad_total”
[5] “grad_sample_size” “grad_employed”
[7] “grad_employed_fulltime_yearround” “grad_unemployed”
[9] “grad_unemployment_rate” “grad_p25th”
[11] “grad_median” “grad_p75th”
[13] “nongrad_total” “nongrad_employed”
[15] “nongrad_employed_fulltime_yearround” “nongrad_unemployed”
[17] “nongrad_unemployment_rate” “nongrad_p25th”
[19] “nongrad_median” “nongrad_p75th”
[21] “grad_share” “grad_premium”
2. Data Summary (30 points): Use your newly assigned data frame for Question 2:
Write an R command that gives you the column names of the data frame. Right after that, write one that counts the number of columns but not rows. Hint: The number should match one of your numbers in Question 1d for dimensions
colnames(HW4) [1] “major_code” “major”
[3] “major_category” “grad_total”
[5] “grad_sample_size” “grad_employed”
[7] “grad_employed_fulltime_yearround” “grad_unemployed”
[9] “grad_unemployment_rate” “grad_p25th”
[11] “grad_median” “grad_p75th”
[13] “nongrad_total” “nongrad_employed”
[15] “nongrad_employed_fulltime_yearround” “nongrad_unemployed”
[17] “nongrad_unemployment_rate” “nongrad_p25th”
[19] “nongrad_median” “nongrad_p75th”
[21] “grad_share” “grad_premium”
ncol(HW4) [1] 22
Generate a count of each unique major_category in the data frame. I recommend using libraries to help. I have demonstrated one briefly in live-session. To be clear, this should look like a matrix or data frame containing the major_category and the frequency it occurs in the dataset. Assign it to major_count.
major_count <- table(HW4$major_category) major_count

c. To make things easier to read, put par(las=2) before your plot to make the text perpendicular to the axis. Make a barplot of major_count. Make sure to label the title with something informative (check the vignette if you need), label the x and y axis, and make it any color other than grey. Assign the major_category labels to their respective bar. Flip the barplot horizontally so that bars extend to the right, not upward. All of these options can be done in a single pass of barplot(). Note: It’s okay if it’s wider than the preview pane.

barplot(major_count, horiz = TRUE, col = rainbow(2), xlab = “category”, ylab = “amount”, main = “Major Category”)
